      apt:
        name: new_package
        state: present

14. Update the name of the play in /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml playbook to Execute a date command on localhost.

CheckCompleteIncomplete
Updated the name of the play in "playbook.yaml" playbook to "Execute a date command on localhost"?

Run the playbook to make sure it works fine.

playbooks]$ ls
ansible.cfg  inventory  playbook.yaml
[bob@student-node playbooks]$ vi playbook.yaml 

---
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: 'Execute a date command'
      command: date

A. 


15. Update the playbook /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml to add a task name Task to display hosts file for the existing task.

CheckCompleteIncomplete
Updated the playbook "playbook.yaml" to add a task name "Task to display hosts file" for the existing task?

A. 


18. Refer to the /home/bob/playbooks/inventory file. We would like to run the /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml on all servers defined under web_nodes group.

Note: Use the group name in playbook as defined in the inventory file.

CheckCompleteIncomplete
